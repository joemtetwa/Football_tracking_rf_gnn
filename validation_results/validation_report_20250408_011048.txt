5. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
Issues detected:
  - Out-of-bounds positions: 4212 points
  - Large position jumps: 83 jumps

Recommendations:
  - Review out-of-bounds positions and apply boundary constraints if needed.
  - Apply smoothing to reduce unrealistic position jumps.
  - Consider applying temporal smoothing if not already done.
  - Validate predictions against known ball movement patterns in football.
